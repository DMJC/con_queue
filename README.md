# con_queue

A simple GTKmm and GStreamer based cueing application skeleton.

## Building

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Running `./con_queue` will open three windows: a playback window that toggles fullscreen with the **F** key, a playlist window with a cue list and controls, and a clock window.
